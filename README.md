# Analysis and Simulation of Series Resonant Converter (SRC)

MTP Part 1 | Energy Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay

📌 **Overview**

This repository contains the analytical modeling and simulation results for the Series Resonant Converter. This was the first phase of my Master's Thesis, aimed at understanding resonant tank behavior and the First Harmonic Approximation (FHA) method.

🚀 **Key Technical Work**

Modeling: Derived and validated SRC gain equations using the FHA method.

Simulation: Conducted PLECS simulations to compare analytical gain vs. simulated output.

Operating Modes: Analyzed operation above and below resonance to identify Zero Current Switching (ZCS) regions.

Limitations: Identified the "no-load regulation" issue inherent in SRCs, justifying the move toward LLC topologies
