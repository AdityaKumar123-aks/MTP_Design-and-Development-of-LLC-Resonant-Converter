# Design and Development of LLC Resonant Converter for EV Charging

Master's Thesis Project | IIT Bombay (2025 - Present) 


## 📖 Executive Summary

This repository documents the systematic research, analytical modeling, and hardware development of high-efficiency resonant converters for Electric Vehicle charging. The project follows a three-stage evolution: exploring **Series Resonant (SRC)** and **Parallel Resonant (PRC)** topologies before final implementation of the **LLC Resonant Converter**.


## 🏗 Project Roadmap

To explore specific phases of the project, switch to the corresponding branches:

**[Branch: SRC] — Part 1: Series Resonant Converter**
Focus: FHA method validation and ZCS analysis.

**[Branch: PRC] — Part 2: Parallel Resonant Converter**
Focus: Gain characteristics mapping and load regulation studies.

**[Branch: LLC] — Part 3: LLC Resonant Converter (Current Focus)**
Focus: 1kW hardware implementation, Altium PCB design, and TMS320F28379D control.
