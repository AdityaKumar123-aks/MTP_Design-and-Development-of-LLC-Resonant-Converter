# Analysis, Simulation and Hardware Implementation of Parallel Resonant Converter (PRC)

MTP Part 2 | Energy Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay

## 📌 Overview

Following the SRC study, this phase focused on the Parallel Resonant Converter (PRC). The goal was to evaluate its suitability for wide load variations and its ability to step up/down voltage, which is critical for EV charging infrastructure.

## 🚀 Key Technical Work

Gain Analysis: Mapped the PRC gain equations and compared results with simulation data in PLECS.

Soft Switching: Investigated Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) conditions for the inverter bridge.

Comparison: Evaluated PRC performance against SRC, specifically noting its high circulating current at light loads.
